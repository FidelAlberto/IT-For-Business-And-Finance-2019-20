## Setup [TO BE COMPLETED]
### Course working directory setup
a. If you are familiar with [github](https://github.com/), that's great _you are a boss!_, follow these steps:

  0. Step into a directory where you want your local copy of the [IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20) remote repo to be created;
  
  1. clone the course repo into your current directory typing: `git clone https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20.git`. A local folder named _IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20_ will be created, which includes all the contents of the remote repository (as they will be at that point in time);
  
  2. To update your local copy of the remote branch with the updates I will make to the remote repo (e.g. new material uploaded), simply `git pull` into your local copy folder. **WARNING: doing this way you may have conflicts, so be prepared to manage them, otherwise go for option _b._**

b. If not, no panic _Rome wasn't built in a day_, follow these steps: 

  0. Download the remote repo as a ZIP folder into your local machine (see picture)

  1. Un-zip the _IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20_ folder, which includes all the contents of the remote repository (as they will be at that point in time);
  
  2. To update your local copy of the remote branch with the updates I will make to the remote repo (e.g. new material uploaded), you can repeate steps _0._ and _1._, creating each time a brand new local folder or:
    2.1 locate the new/updated files in the remote repo  
    2.2 push the _Raw_ button on the top-right corner of the file (see picture)

    2.3 Save it from browser into your local machine, respecting the folder/sub-folder structure.
