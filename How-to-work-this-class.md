## How to work IN CLASS <a name="class"></a>

### Before the lessons starts <a name="before_class"></a>
These are the X steps you need to be done **before** the lesson starts to effectively follow any in-class lesson:

0. In Google Chrome, go to the class webpage at [github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20). 

  - *TIP*: If not done already, add the class webpage to the list of favorites (see figure [1](#add_bookmark))

3. Launch the Jupyer Notebook App (see figure [3](#launch_jupyer_nb)). A new panel in Chrome opens, listing the directories in your machine (see figure [4](#dir_structure_machine))

4. Navigate to folder `/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20/Notebooks` (left-click on the blue links to step into the folders) and open the Notebook of the lesson (I will tell you which) clicking on the blue link to the `.ipynb` file (see figure [5](#how_to_open_nb).

Now you are all setup and can start following the lesson on the open Notebook, taking notes on the Notebook etc...
